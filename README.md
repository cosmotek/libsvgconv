 # libsvgconv
 
 Libsvgconv is a simple C library (with LuaJIT wrapper) for converting SVG files into PNG files with some resizing allowed.
 This library is experimental (I'm not very confident in my C skills), so use at your own risk. If you get some use out this
 library and find that it needs work, let me know as I would be willing to invest time if people get something out of it. Thanks
 and enjoy!
